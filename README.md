# dog-breed-classification

## Dataset
[Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/)

## Motivation
1. practice my understand about dnn,cnn. then you can talk about what is dnn , cnn

2. kaggle cat vs dog competition. this project take this into next level by doing dog-breed classifaction

3. dataset itself is great. i can do soemthing with it.

## Third-partiy package I used
1.Keras

2.Tensorflow

3.Sklearn

4.numpy

## My approach
1.Human-face detector: OpenCV pre-trained haarcascade_frontalface classifier 
(u can also talk about type I, type II erros here)

2.Dog-face detector: ResNet50 pre-trained model using imageNet data from Keras

3.Transfer learning using resnet 50


## Next steps
1.More data (why more data can help?)
### [The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/)

2.Better architecture

3.Web-based app
